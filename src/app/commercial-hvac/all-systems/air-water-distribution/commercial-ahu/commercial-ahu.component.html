<p>Air handling units &lpar;AHUs&rpar; are devices that transfer heat between water&sol;refrigerant and air and regulate the air supply throughout a building. The hot/cold water coming from the central plant passes through coils. The heating/cooling can also be provided directly by the refrigerant in a direct expansion &lpar;DX&rpar; air-conditioning system.</p>

<p>A blow&sol;draw through fan blows&sol;draws air over the coils, then circulates it through the building ducts. The AHU has an opening for return air &lpar;recirculated from the building&rpar; and outside air &lpar;fresh air taken in for ventilation purposes&rpar;. An important component of the AHU is the filter. Commonly used filters include fiberglass; polyester; pleated, high efficiency particulate &lpar;HEPA&rpar; and washable air filters. Filter effectiveness is rated based on the minimum energy reporting value &lpar;MERV&rpar; ranging from 1 to 16. The higher the MERV rating, the more effective the filter, i.e., it can catch finer particles. Filters with higher MERV ratings have higher pressure drops compared to those with lower MERV ratings; however, not all high-MERV filters have high pressure drops. MERV ratings â‰¥ are efficient for capturing airborne viruses. Ultraviolet &lpar;UV&rpar; energy, especially UV-C energy, can be an effective method to inactivate viral, bacterial, and fungal organisms to clean the indoor air and AHU coils. UV systems should be carefully designed, installed, and maintained to avoid human exposure and proper performance.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>

<h3>Fan Coil Units</h3>
<p>A fan coil unit (FCU) is an assembly of a fan, heating/cooling coil, and sometimes a filter. It typically serves single zones but can serve multiple zones in some special systems such as the variable refrigerant flow system. FCUs can be served by refrigerant or water. Direct expansion (DX)-type FCUs are installed in electrical rooms where water is not allowed. FCUs are also used in residential buildings.</p>

<h3>Packaged Air Handling Unit</h3>
<p>Packaged air handling units (AHUs) are also called rooftop units (RTUs). The components include a fan, DX cooling system, gas/electric heat source, and filters. Because they are stand-alone units, they are easy to install and maintain compared to an AHU that serves by a central plant. The DX system can be air- or water-cooled.</p>

<h3>Modular Air Handling Unit</h3>
<p>A modular AHU allows the user to customize and choose individual AHU components depending on project requirements. These AHUs are useful at sites that have design constraints such as space limitations or a corrosive environment.</p>

<h3>Custom Air Handling Unit</h3>
<p>A custom AHU is similar to a modular AHU, except that they offer greater flexibility in the design of individual components. They are more expensive compared to the other three AHU types.</p>

<h2>Performance Ratings</h2>

<h3>Air Leakage</h3>
<div class="col-md-6 float-md-left mr-md-5 my-3">
  <blockquote>"Lowering cabinet air leakage from 5% to 1.5% of system air flow would result in an overall reduction in energy use for space conditioning of about 5% and a reduction of 5% or more energy use for peak heating and cooling loads."</blockquote>

</div>

<p>Air leakage in an air handling unit (AHU) leads to energy waste and indoor air quality problems because the AHU is generally located in a mechanical room with no air quality control measure. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 193-2010 (RA 2014) outlines the test method for determining the airtightness of HVAC equipment. The scope of this testing methodology is applicable for equipment moving less than 3,000 cfm of air. Furnaces, coil boxes, and plenums are the main areas of leakage. The <a href="https://consensus.fsu.edu/FBC/ECTSWG/Text_comp.pdf">Florida Building Code</a> Section 13-610.2.A.2.1, Factory Sealed Air Handling Unit Credit, allows an incentive for AHUs that have been tested and have achieved a leakage rate of 2% or less (of the total flow) at a pressure of 1 in. (water column) with all air inlets/ports closed.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2010/data/papers/1916.pdf">Air Leakage of Furnaces and Air Handlers</a> report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for an overview of methodologies used to test the airtightness of AHUs.</p>

<h2>Energy Efficiency Measures</h2>
<p>The key components of air handling unit (AHU) design are fans, coils, and filters. Decisions made upfront regarding their design can significantly influence the overall energy use of the AHU during its operating life. Low pressure drop design is crucial, especially for AHUs with long run hours, such as those serving laboratories. Refer to the Labs 21 report on <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy05osti/36907.pdf">Low-Pressure-Drop HVAC Design for Laboratories</a> from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for more details.</p>

<h3>Fans</h3>
<p>Fans should be able to meet airflow and pressure requirements while adhering to the design constraints of space and acoustic requirements. A <a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/commercial_initiative/hvac_volume2_final_report.pdf">study by Arthur D. Little for the U.S. Department of Energy</a> estimated the parasitic energy consumption (i.e., the energy required for distributing heating and cooling inside a building, heat rejection, and ventilation) in commercial buildings to be 1.5 quads. Out of total parasitic load, <strong>supply fans consumed 50% of the energy</strong>. Thus, AHU fan selection can have a major impact on overall energy consumption. Details about selecting efficient fans can be found in the <a routerLink="/commercial-hvac/distribution/fans">fans section</a> of this website.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" style="max-width:80% !important;" src="assets/images/ahu_pie.png" alt="Pie chart showing parasitic primary energy consumption per equipment. Supply and return fans are 50%, chilled water pumps are 2%, condenser water pumps are 2%, heating water pumps are 5%, cooling tower fans are 1%, condenser fans are 5%, and fan powered terminal boxes are 2%, and exhaust fans are 33%.">

<h3>Coils</h3>
<p>Cooling and heating coil capacity is generally measured in thousands of Btu per hour (MBH). Air-side and water-side pressure drops are the important parameters to evaluate when sizing the coil to meet the required load.</p>

<p>Low delta-T at the chiller is one of the major reasons for inefficient overall energy performance, and cooling coil design at the AHU influences the delta-T at the chiller. A larger delta-T offers a number of advantages, such as lower flow, lower pump energy, and better chiller capacity. For more information about design and operational techniques to achieve a larger delta-T, refer to <a href="https://tayloreng.egnyte.com/dl/2nX81OnoU9/ASHRAE_Symposium_-_AC-02-6-1_Degrading_Delta-T.pdf_">Degrading Chilled Water Plant Delta-T: Causes and Mitigation</a>, by Steven Taylor, Taylor Engineering.</p>

<p>Coil design also includes considerations such as header orientation/material, coil hand, material, fins per inch, and face velocity. For typical ranges used in the industry for designing each parameter, refer to <a href="https://www.dac-hvac.com/custom-air-handling-units-coil-selection-guidelines/">Coil Selection Guidelines</a>, by Jim Shiminski, DAC Sales.</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>The first step in efficient filter design is to understand the indoor air quality requirements of the space. If it is a critical application such as an operating room or if it is an owner requirement, high efficiency HEPA filters maybe used. Location of the jobsite also needs to be considered when selecting filters. The pressure drop associated with the filter assembly should be closely evaluated at startup and also at intermediate loading.</p>

<h2>Operation and Training</h2>
<p>Periodic evaluation of air handlers is recommended to identify efficiency measures. The evaluation generally consists of a combination of on-site observations and a more detailed testing of air handling unit (AHU) components. The  <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy11/50134.pdf">General Air Handling Unit Checklist</a> published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory lists a number of measures to save energy in commercial buildings by improving the operational efficiency of AHUs. These measures are summarized below; refer to the <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy11/50134.pdf">General Air Handling Unit Checklist</a> for more information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verifying proper operation of air dampers </li>
  <li>Verifying proper operation of air-side economizer</li>
  <li>Verifying proper operation of heating and cooling valves</li>
  <li>Checking the condition of heating and cooling coils and AHU filters</li>
  <li>Identifying and eliminating duct leakage</li>
  <li>Eliminating 100% outside air systems in applications where 100% fresh air is not needed</li>
  <li>Reducing outside airflow rate to ASHRAE 62.1 recommended values</li>
  <li>Implementing HVAC system night setback schedule</li>
  <li>Tracking HVAC setback schedule</li>
  <li>Monitoring exhaust fan controls</li>
  <li>Operating systems at part load during unoccupied hours</li>
  <li>Converting constant volume systems to variable volume</li>
  <li>Resetting the supply air temperature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat transfer effectiveness of the coil is reduced due to fouling. This in turn increases the water flow rate and reduces the delta-T. Chemical treatment is recommended to control fouling.</p>

<h2>Procurement and Performance</h2>

<h3>Air Leakage</h3>
<p>Wherever possible, air leakage requirements should be specified for air handling units (AHUs). Because there is not much guidance available for acceptable ranges of AHU leakage rates, the requirements set by the <a href= "https://consensus.fsu.edu/FBC/ECTSWG/Text_comp.pdf">State of Florida</a> are a good starting point. Section 13-610.2.A.2.1 allows a leakage rate of 2% or less (of the total flow) at a pressure of 1 in. (water column) with all air inlets/ports closed.</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>ASHRAE Standard 52.2 defines the minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) rating, which is a widely used metric for system performance. Although filters with higher MERV ratings can catch finer particles, they have a greater pressure drop. In addition, it is important to pay special attention to the pressure drop when the filter is loaded. It is recommended that engineers specify filter pressure drop requirements in the performance specifications.</p>

<h2>Case Studies</h2>
<p><a href="https://technologyportal.ashrae.org/Journal/ArticleDetail/120">34-floor building on Times Square in New York city</a><br>
  This study involved cleaning the coils of two AHUs with cooling capacities of 121 tons and 81 tons respectively. There were four AHUs in total, serving an area of 1.2 million ft<sup>2</sup>. The coils of the AHU under study were 30 years old. The study resulted in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An estimated energy savings of up to $40,000 for the first year</li>
  <li>A decrease in the pressure drop across the coil of approximately 14%</li>
  <li>An increase in tonnage of 19â€“20 tons to the 81 ton AHU</li>
  <li>An increase in thermal efficiency of 25% for sensible heat load and 10% for latent load.</li>
</ul>
