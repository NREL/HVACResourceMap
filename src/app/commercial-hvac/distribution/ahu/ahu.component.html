<p>Air handling units &lpar;AHUs&rpar; are devices that transfer heat between water&sol;refrigerant and air and regulate the air supply throughout a building. The hot/cold water coming from the central plant passes through coils. The heating/cooling can also be provided directly by the refrigerant in a direct expansion &lpar;DX&rpar; air-conditioning system.</p>

<p>A blow&sol;draw through fan blows&sol;draws air over the coils, then circulates it through the building ducts. The AHU has an opening for return air &lpar;recirculated from the building&rpar; and outside air &lpar;fresh air taken in for ventilation purposes&rpar;. An important component of the AHU is the filter. Commonly used filters include fiberglass; polyester; pleated, high efficiency particulate &lpar;HEPA&rpar; and washable air filters. Filter effectiveness is rated based on the minimum energy reporting value &lpar;MERV&rpar; ranging from 1 to 16. The higher the MERV rating, the more effective the filter, i.e., it can catch finer particles. Filters with higher MERV ratings have higher pressure drops compared to those with lower MERV ratings; however, not all high-MERV filters have high pressure drops. MERV ratings â‰¥ are efficient for capturing airborne viruses. Ultraviolet &lpar;UV&rpar; energy, especially UV-C energy, can be an effective method to inactivate viral, bacterial, and fungal organisms to clean the indoor air and AHU coils. UV systems should be carefully designed, installed, and maintained to avoid human exposure and proper performance.</p>
