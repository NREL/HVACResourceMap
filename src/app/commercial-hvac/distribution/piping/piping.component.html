<p>The piping network is one of the important and expensive components in a centralized district cold/hot water or steam distribution system. These pipes are generally buried underground and need to supply the working fluid to the individual buildings at the appropriate pressure and temperature. Pipe failures can critically affect the building operation at the facility. Pipe materials commonly used for chilled and hot water applications are shown in the table below:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pumpsandsystems.com/what-primary-secondary-pumping">Primary-secondary pumping</a> is a common fluid (water/glycol) distribution piping design found in commercial buildings. The two fluid circuits are coupled by a small length of common pipe, yet fluid can be pumped through their respective loops at different flow rates.</p>

<p>The primary pump and circulation loop circulates fluid into and around the chiller or boiler where the fluid is heated or cooled. Hot or cold fluid from the primary loop can be drawn through the common pipe by the secondary loop pumps. Fluid in the secondary loop is circulated to one or more air handling unit (AHU) heating or cooling coils. Since the two fluid circuits can operate at different flows, the primary loop is designed to satisfy the flows required by the boiler or chillers while the secondary loop flows operate independently to meet space the conditioning loads at the AHUs.</p>

<p>As the fluid is heated or cooled in the circulation loop, thermal expansion of the water/glycol occurs. To accommodate the fluid’s volumetric change in a rigidly piped system, an <a href="https://tayloreng.egnyte.com/dl/mfpo1R0rfG/ASHRAE_Journal_-_The_Fundamentals_of_Expansion_Tanks.pdf_">expansion tank</a> is added. These simple passive devices, commonly misunderstood on how they impact the system pressures as the pump circulates the fluid in the loops, need to be properly sized and located.</p>
