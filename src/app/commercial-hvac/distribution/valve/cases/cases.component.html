  <br>Pressure drop through valves have a significant impact on pump energy consumption. A study by Texas A&amp;M University at their central plant revealed that 30%â€“50% of primary pump head is consumed by manual and automatic valves operated in partially-opened condition. Researchers estimated that developing a pump management schedule could result in a 40% savings in pump energy.</p>
