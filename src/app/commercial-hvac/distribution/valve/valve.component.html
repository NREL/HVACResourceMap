<p>Valves are throttling devices used to regulate the flow of liquids and gases. They are widely used in central plants to regulate the flow of hot and cold water.</p>
<p>Valves play a key role in overall plant energy consumption because of the pressure drop they introduce in the flow. If valves are selected, installed, and operated incorrectly, they can lead to an oversized pump design with a heavy energy penalty. It is thus important for engineers and facility managers to be familiar with different valve types and their applications and performance parameters in order to design and operate them for optimal energy performance.</p>

<h2>Performance Ratings</h2>
<p>Testing standards are important for valves, mainly to understand leakage for a given valve type. Leakage allowances are more critical in the petroleum industry but are also important for central plants. A few standards for valve leakage testing are given below.</p>

<h3>American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Fluid Controls Institute (FCI) Standard 70-2: Control Valve Seat Leakage</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Defines a range of six leakage classes for control valves and their testing procedures</li>
  <li>Outlines leakage rate in ml/min and bubbles/min for a range of nominal port diameters</li>
  <li>Most commonly used standard for hot/cold valve applications.</li>

<h3>International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standard 5208: Industrial Valvesâ€”Pressure testing of metallic valves</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Outlines different pressure tests and class types for valve types such as globe, plug, check, diaphragm, and butterfly.</li>
  <li>Leakage rate specified in mm3/sec and drops/sec for different rate types.</li>

<h2>Energy Efficiency Measures</h2>
<h3>Valve Sizing Considerations</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://tayloreng.egnyte.com/dl/ui3Jf0FuWy/EDR_Design_Guidelines_CoolTools_Chilled_Water.pdf_">Chilled Water Plant Design Guide</a> has a detailed section on valve selection criteria. Rules of thumb play a significant role in valve design. One example of a rule of thumb is that if a valve is sized to operate between 60% and 80% open at maximum flow and not less than 20% open at minimum flow, it yields the best flow control result (Source: <a href="https://www.valin.com/resources/blog/rules-thumb-techniques-and-considerations-properly-sizing-control-valves">Valin</a>).</p>

<p>Few important valve sizing considerations from the <a href="https://tayloreng.egnyte.com/dl/ui3Jf0FuWy/EDR_Design_Guidelines_CoolTools_Chilled_Water.pdf_#page=128">Chilled Water Plant Design Guide</a> are listed below. Refer to section 5, pages 14â€“17 for more details.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determine <strong>valve pressure drop</strong> such that it is a significant portion of the overall system pressure drop. Oversized valves will cause large flow variations with small change in valve position, while an undersized valve will introduce a large pressure drop.</li>
  <li>Select valve based on pressure drop and <strong>valve flow coefficient (Cv)</strong>.</li>
  <li>Estimate number of <strong>actuation cycles</strong> each valve is likely to be subjected to in a year. </li>
  <li>Clearly specify <strong>operational environment</strong> and performance requirements of each valve.</li>
  <li>Check for <strong>close-off pressure capability</strong>, especially for gate valves.</li>
  <li>Wherever possible, purchase <strong>control valve and actuator as one unit.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Valve Insulation</h3>
<p>Prevention of heat loss through valves is important on steam, hot water, and cold water lines. Valves are also insulated as a safety measure on steam lines. Refer to the U.S. Department of Energy Tip Sheet #17: <a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/tech_assistance/pdfs/steam17_valves_fittings.pdf">Installing Removable Insulation on Valves and Fittings</a>. The document includes a table that gives energy savings in Btu/hr for different valve sizes across operating temperatures ranging from 200Â°â€“600Â°F.</p>

<h2>Design Calculators and Tools</h2>

  <li><a href="https://www.swagelok.com/en/toolbox/cv-calculator">Cv Calculator</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Operation and Training</h2>
<p>Fault identification in control valves is difficult, because they are not always in locations that can be easily seen. It is not uncommon for someone to manually override a valve and keep it in that position indefinitely. Such incidents are diagnosed only when there is a related heating/cooling complaint.</p>

<h3>Methods to Ensure Valves are Functioning Properly</h3>
<p>(Source:<a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/OM_9.pdf">FEMP Operation and Maintenance Best practices</a>, Chapter 9)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check the temperature of the heating coil on the direct digital control system. If it is receiving hot water, the value displayed will be in the expected range. Now check if the zone it is serving is calling for heating. If the zone is not calling for heating, then the valve is malfunctioning because of leakage or a manual override. The same procedure can be applied for cooling coils and for bigger systems such as hot/cold water lines from the central plant.</li>
  <li>Fully open a heating/cooling valve and review the temperature reading on both sides of the coil. If the difference is more than 2&deg;â€“ 4&deg;F, the valve or the sensor is malfunctioning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case Studies</h2>
<p><a href="https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/4a7964fb-6611-479f-9608-301a3ff5867a/content">Central Utility Plant at Texas A&M University</a>
  <br>Pressure drop through valves have a significant impact on pump energy consumption. A study by Texas A&M University at their central plant revealed that 30%â€“50% of primary pump head is consumed by manual and automatic valves operated in partially-opened condition. Researchers estimated that developing a pump management schedule could result in a 40% savings in pump energy.</p>
