<p>Valves are throttling devices used to regulate the flow of liquids and gases. They are widely used in central plants to regulate the flow of hot and cold water.</p>
<p>Valves play a key role in overall plant energy consumption because of the pressure drop they introduce in the flow. If valves are selected, installed, and operated incorrectly, they can lead to an oversized pump design with a heavy energy penalty. It is thus important for engineers and facility managers to be familiar with different valve types and their applications and performance parameters in order to design and operate them for optimal energy performance.</p>
