<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

<p>Fans are the principal mechanism for moving air in buildings and play an essential role in maintaining comfortable and healthy indoor environments. Fans are also key components in cooling systems. Fans consume approximately 139 billion kWh of electricity annually<sup>1</sup> or approximately 25% of the HVAC electrical energy in commercial buildings.<sup>2</sup> Significant energy savings and performance enhancement opportunities are available through proper selection, system design, and operational practices. For example, adding a variable speed drive to a constant speed fan can reduce energy consumption by more than 50% in the right applications.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of fans—axial and centrifugal. Axial fans move air along the axis of the fan using the aerodynamic lift of the spinning fan blades. Centrifugal fans use centrifugal force to turn kinetic energy into pressure in the air stream. Centrifugal fans are the most common fans in HVAC systems. Propeller axial fans are good at moving large volumes of air at low pressures. Vaneaxial fans can provide high pressures and good flow and can be used interchangeably with centrifugal fans in some HVAC applications.</p>

<h3>Drives</h3>
<p>Belt (indirect) driven fans are the most common fan type. They have the advantages of being easily accessible for maintenance, simple to maintain, and easy to adjust to the speed specified in the system design. The main disadvantage is an efficiency loss of 3% to 5% compared to direct drive. Synchronous drive belts can improve system performance by 2%. Direct drive fans can provide higher efficiency and have a simpler design than belt driven fans. However, they may result in increased stress on the motor and bearings, and most applications require a method to control speed, such as a variable frequency drive.</p>

<h3>Motors</h3>
<p>Most HVAC system motors are AC induction motors with single phase motors for small systems (&lt;5 hp) and three phase motors for larger systems. The most common single phase motors are permanent split capacitance and some shaded pole (smaller motors and very low performance). Speed control and improved part load efficiency can be achieved with the addition of variable frequency drives (VFDs), although VFDs add a 3% to 5% efficiency penalty. More efficient motor options include permanent magnet motors (e.g., electrically commutated [EC]) and switched reluctance motors. EC and other permanent magnet motors are widely available for small (&lt;1 hp) motors and are starting to become more available for mid-sized motors (2–5 hp). Switched reluctance motors have the advantage of not using expensive rare earth materials and recent advances are overcoming speed and vibration control challenges.</p>

<h2>Operation and Training</h2>
<p>Designing and installing high performing fan systems is a good first step, but to achieve and sustain intended performance, system commissioning and ongoing maintenance are required. Testing and balancing of air systems also matches installed equipment to design intent and reduces energy use that can result from improperly balanced systems.</p>

<h2>Procurement and Performance Specifications</h2>
<p>With variability in quality and performance between various HVAC equipment manufacturers, it is important to have specifications that define minimum requirements beyond basic capacity. Specifications that include features that allow for appropriate maintenance of equipment will help operations teams sustain efficient performance.</p>

<p>For example, proper and easy access to clean coils, change filters, and check system operation will cut long term cost of ownership. Easy access is not always provided by HVAC manufactures on base equipment.</p>

<p>In addition to basic specification of the HVAC equipment, these systems have options available depending on application. Typical options that should be considered during design and specification include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Humidification</li>
  <li>Dehumidification</li>
  <li>High efficiency filtration</li>
  <li>Air flow measuring station</li>
  <li>Air side economizing</li>

<h2>Tune-Up measures</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Fans are used extensively in commercial buildings and represent approximately 6% of total energy consumed by commercial buildings. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that fans in commercial buildings consume 158 billion kWh of electricity annually (<a href="https://data.openei.org/submissions/144">DOE, 2011 Buildings Energy Data Book</a>). Maintaining fan systems in proper condition provides energy savings and ensures a comfortable and healthy environment. While many fan systems have significant energy savings opportunities available through improvements in fan selection, system design, and operational practices, it is not always apparent when a fan system needs maintenance or what opportunities are available for improvements. This resource is designed for facility managers and maintenance staff to provide easy-to-implement actionable guidance on fan efficiency measures for existing ducted air systems.</p>

<p>Maintaining fan systems is described with routine operations and maintenance (O&M) measures and replacement and improvement (RI) measures. The measures are divided across the entire fan system and by major components of control/motor, drive train, fan, and airflow distribution with detailed sections for each component in this document. Table 1 provides the relative evaluations for the effort required, savings potential, payback, and persistence of the efficiency measures.</p>

<p>This information is available in the document <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70566.pdf">Tune-Up Your Fan Systems for Improved Performance</a> (PDF).</p>

<h3>Measure Descriptions</h3>
<p>Inefficiencies in fan systems can be attributed to faults related to the fan equipment or the ventilation system includes the fan, motor, supply ductwork, return ductwork, etc.) as a whole. The measures listed here are classified as routine O&M of each component or as potential RI to increase component or system efficiency. Each measure has a brief description on how to implement the measure. For more information and a detailed list of references, refer to the other sections of this <a routerLink="/">HVAC Resource Map</a>. Many of the maintenance suggestions on this page were provided by ASHRAE Standard 180-2012, <em>Standard Practice for Inspection and Maintenance of Commercial Building HVAC Systems</em>.
</p>

<p><strong>In applying any of the measures, safety is the foremost concern. The recommended measures should be implemented only by trained and certified professionals.</strong></p>

<h2>Routine Operation and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Fan performance can be compromised by component problems and can be corrected with proper maintenance. Tables O&M 1-4 provide maintenance checklists for each component type. The main goals include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check for proper operation compared with design intent.</li>
  <li>Check for fan system failures or worn components.</li>
  <li>Prevent fan system energy cost increases due to inefficient operation.</li>
</ol>

          <br>Building occupants are valuable resources on the operation of the ventilation system. They can bring up issues that are not obvious during maintenance, such as loud fan noises or difficulty opening or shutting doors that can indicate fan system issues. Occupants can also be a source for incorrect system operation. System controls that are manually adjusted for increased comfort and not changed back can and lead to increased energy expenditure. Occupants may also block airflow paths. Consider the root cause for the occupant's action and try to reduce the chance of it reoccurring.

          <br>A common issue with fan systems is providing insufficient airflow.

Measure airflow to determine if it is outside the range. If it is low, check to make sure that the entire system is operating correctly then proceed through the other checklists to look for reasons the airflow is low. If it is high, it is possible that the fan is oversized or control is not providing adequate airflow reductions.

        <td><strong>Replace existing V-belts with notched or synchronous belts</strong><br>
          Notched belts run cooler, have longer durability, and run with an efficiency of ~97% compared to a peak of 95% for V-belts. Synchronous belts operate at ~98% efficiency over a wider load range, need minimal maintenance and can operate in wet/oily environments. However, they transfer more vibrations, are sometimes noisier than V-belts and less suited for shock-load applications.

        <td><strong>Reduce fan speed</strong><br>
          If it is possible to lower the fan speed, substantial reductions in power consumption are possible. Fan power consumption has nearly a cubed relationship to fan speed. For example, reducing the fan speed by 5% equates to almost 15% reduction in fan power. The entire system needs to be analyzed to ensure that no adverse effects occur to airflow and ventilation, before attempting to lower fan speed.

          Removing bends in ducting and improving transition ductwork all reduce pressure drop along the airflow path. If the changes are significant, a testing, adjust, and balancing test should be completed to make sure the ventilation system is adjusted for the reduction in pressure.

          Duct leakage can result in significant energy waste because the conditioned airflow is not efficiently being distributed. A California study indicated that initial duct leakage of 90 cfm/ton was reduced to 16 cfm/ton by utilizing a commercially available aerosol spray for 300 light commercial buildings. Additionally, circular geometry ductwork may reduce leakage due to the lack of sharp corners.
