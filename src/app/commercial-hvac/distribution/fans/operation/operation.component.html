<p>Designing and installing high performing fan systems is a good first step, but to achieve and sustain intended performance, system commissioning and ongoing maintenance are required. Testing and balancing of air systems also matches installed equipment to design intent and reduces energy use that can result from improperly balanced systems.</p>
