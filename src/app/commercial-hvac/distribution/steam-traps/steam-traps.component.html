<p>"A steam trap is a device for allowing the passage of condensate and preventing the passage of steam, or for allowing the passage of air as well as condensate. Common steam trap types include float and thermostatic (F&T) traps, inverted-bucket traps, and thermodynamic traps." - <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/free-resources/ashrae-terminology">ASHRAE terminology</a></p>
<p>When condensate gets collected it reduces the heat transfer efficiency and can cause water hammer effect.</p>

<h2>Design Calculators and Tools</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tlv.com/global/US/calculator/">Engineering Calculators</a>, by TLV company
  <br>Steam traps are devices used to separate and discharge condensates and non-condensable gases from the live steam.</p>

<h2>Operation and Training Resources</h2>
<p>Steam traps need to be tested periodically for cold plugging (blocked condensate discharge or insufficient capacity) and failing in open position such that the steam is escaping into the condensate return system. The three common ways of testing steam trap failures are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Temperature: Works best to identify cold plugging</li>
  <li>Sound: Different sound types for leaking and blocked traps; electronic/ultrasonic instruments are used for greater accuracy</li>
  <li>Visual observation: Condensate not flowing or steam escaping with condensate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case Studies</h2>
<p><a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/FTA_SteamTrap.pdf">Steam Trap Performance Assessment at Veterans Administration (VA) medical centers</a>
  <br>Three hospitals located in Providence, Rhode Island, and Brockton and West Roxbury, Massachusetts, were inspected and evaluated to estimate stream trap losses due to malfunctioning. Based on different steam pressures and end uses, steam losses were estimated at $5.25 per 1,000 pounds of steam at Providence and $4.25 per 1,000 pounds of steam at Brockton and West Roxbury. The annual estimated savings was $18,695 at Providence, $70,511 at Brockton, and $3,117 at West Roxbury.</p>
