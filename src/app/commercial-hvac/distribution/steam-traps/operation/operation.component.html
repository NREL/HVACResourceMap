<p>Steam traps need to be tested periodically for cold plugging (blocked condensate discharge or insufficient capacity) and failing in open position such that the steam is escaping into the condensate return system. The three common ways of testing steam trap failures are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Temperature: Works best to identify cold plugging</li>
  <li>Sound: Different sound types for leaking and blocked traps; electronic/ultrasonic instruments are used for greater accuracy</li>
  <li>Visual observation: Condensate not flowing or steam escaping with condensate.</li>
</ul>
