<p>Periodic boiler evaluation is required to ensure that the boiler is operating as designed.</p>

<h4>Example of actions that need special attention during the testing process include:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Verifying proper boiler staging under normal operation, failure, and emergency modes; proper coordination between boiler staging and load variation will save energy</li>
  <li>Verifying boiler starts/stops with the time delay specified during design</li>
  <li>Verifying that all control loops stabilize within a reasonable time (typically 2â€“5 minutes) after a significant load change.</li>
</ul>
