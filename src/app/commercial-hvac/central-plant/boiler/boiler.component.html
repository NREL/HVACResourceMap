<p>Boilers heat water to produce hot water or steam for heating. The hot water or steam is supplied from the centralized heating plant to different buildings through piping systems. Efficient boiler maintenance and operation is necessary for improving the overall efficiency of the heating plant. The table below gives an overview of some common boiler types.</p>
