<p>Boilers heat water to produce hot water or steam for heating. The hot water or steam is supplied from the centralized heating plant to different buildings through piping systems. Efficient boiler maintenance and operation is necessary for improving the overall efficiency of the heating plant. The table below gives an overview of some common boiler types.</p>

<h2>Performance Ratings</h2>
<p>The efficiency of a boiler is measured by the annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE), which is the ratio of useful energy output to the energy input. This metric is similar to the seasonal energy efficiency rating (SEER) for air conditioners in the sense that it does not represent efficiency at a single point but rather measures efficiency during a season. Minimum AFUE levels are outlined in the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 90.1 2016 for different boiler/fuel types of different sizes.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a routerLink="../procure" fragment="efficiency-requirements"><em>Efficiency Requirements</em> section in the Boiler Procurement and Performance tab</a> of this resource for more details.</p>

<h2>Best practices for Boiler Energy Efficiency</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Modulate the quantity of combustion air:</strong> Excess or deficiency of air should be avoided by periodically checking the air-to-fuel ratio. Refer to the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/check_burner_air2.pdf">Check Burner Air-to-Fuel Ratio</a> tipsheet</li>
  <li><strong>Clean scale and soot formation in the boiler:</strong> Scale and soot formation act as an insulator, reducing heat transfer efficiency and increasing flue gas exhaust temperature.</li>
  <li><strong>Install waste heat recovery:</strong> Waste heat recovery should be installed after ensuring that the boiler is cleaned and tuned. For more details, refer to section 3.0, Waste Heat Recovery Options and Technologies, in the <a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/intensiveprocesses/pdfs/waste_heat_recovery.pdf">Waste Heat Recovery: Technology and Opportunities in U.S. Industry</a> report by the U.S. Department of Energy.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce blowdown cycles and recover waste heat from blowdown:</strong> Determine boiler blowdown cycle by considering boiler type, operating pressure, water treatment, and quality of make-up water. Consider an automatic blowdown control system. Refer to the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/steam9_blowdown.pdf">Minimize Boiler Blowdown</a> tip sheet for more details</li>
  <li><strong>Preheat combustion air: </strong> Wherever possible, consider designing the flue exhaust gas duct such that the heat can be used to preheat the incoming combustion air. Refer to the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/et_preheated.pdf">Preheated Combustion Air</a> tipsheet for more details</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to section 9.2, Boilers, in the <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-19634.pdf">Operations & Maintenance Best Practices</a> document.</p>

<h2>Design Guidance</h2>

<h3>Modular Boilers Versus Large Boiler Design</h3>
<p>A common challenge engineers face is choosing a boiler configuration for the heating system. Typically, heating systems have two boilers, one to meet the heating load and a second as a backup in case the first boiler fails. Alternatively, multiple small boilers can be installed with redundancy. Such a configuration is called modular boiler system.</p>

<h2>Design Calculators and Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.energy.gov/femp/energy-savings-calculator-commercial-boilers">Energy Cost Savings Calculator for Commercial Boilers</a>: This is a cost analysis tool that estimates lifetime energy cost savings at different efficiencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Operation and Training Resources</h2>
<p>Periodic boiler evaluation is required to ensure that the boiler is operating as designed.</p>

<h3>Example of actions that need special attention during the testing process include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Verifying proper boiler staging under normal operation, failure, and emergency modes; proper coordination between boiler staging and load variation will save energy</li>
  <li>Verifying boiler starts/stops with the time delay specified during design</li>
  <li>Verifying that all control loops stabilize within a reasonable time (typically 2–5 minutes) after a significant load change.</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/buildings/tools/BoilerTune-Up_Benefits.pdf">Boiler Tune-Ups fact sheet</a> for a detailed list of boiler systems energy efficiency measures.</p>

<h2>Procurement and Performance</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The purpose of this document is to help owners understand the key aspects of boiler energy efficiency and enable them to include appropriate language in the RFP to facilitate procurement of boilers with the desired features and efficiency levels while staying within their budget. The RFP format can also be used to engage in discussions with engineering design firms to help select a firm that will provide design documents for appropriate high-efficiency boiler systems.</p>
<p>The efficiency requirements section compares boiler efficiencies across different references and lists good and best performance for boilers.</p>

<h3>Questions to ask during evaluation and selection process:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Why do you want to do a boiler replacement?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Is the problem at the boiler level or a system level? Answering this question will help you understand the bigger picture of your hot water or steam system and possibly avoid a like-for-like replacement. A like-for-like replacement is not beneficial, as the system might have been sized incorrectly and be inefficient in meeting the current load.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>What is the return water temperature of the hot water system and the delta T (temperature difference) across the boiler?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Efficiency of a commercial boiler is closely tied to the return water temperature. If you are considering using condensing boilers, the return water temperature needs to be lower than 130°F. If the return water temperature is higher than 130°F, flue gases will not condense and the condensing boiler will not perform as expected.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>If return water temperature is higher than 130°F, consider system evaluation to determine if modifications could be made to lower the water temperature required by the system. Alternately, a hybrid combination of condensing and non-condensing boilers could be used, with the condensing boiler heating return water up to 130°F and conventional boiler heating supply water up to the required higher temperature.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Does the boiler system have supply water temperature reset?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Supply water temperature reset helps meet the required load by reducing the boiler supply water temperature to the lowest possible. This is typically applicable when the boiler system is used for building heat and reset based on outside air temperature. Supply water temperature reset function can improve energy efficiency by about 5%, while modulating the firing rate can improve fuel efficiency by 3%. (Source:<a href="https://cee1.org/"> Consortium for Energy Efficiency [CEE]</a>)</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Is your application suited for a large boiler design or multiple modular units?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Is there a distinct swing in the heating load? If there is, then over what timescale is the swing occurring? If it is over a day, then modular boilers might be a better choice than a large boiler. Work with the designer/vendor to get a price comparison between modular boilers and a large boiler.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>What incentives are available in your area for improving boiler system efficiency?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Some utilities offer various financial incentives to promote efficiency in boiler systems. These incentives might help offset additional upfront cost for high efficiency equipment. Refer to the <i>CEE 2016 Commercial Boiler Systems Program Summary</i> for more details.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Has a heat load calculation been performed for the system?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Oversized boilers are a major concern for hot water systems. Although redundancy and future expansion needs to be taken into account when sizing the boiler, an oversized boiler designed completely on "rules of thumb" can lead to short-cycling and a loss of efficiency in the range of 10%–15%. Requesting a heat load calculation in your RFP (without increasing paperwork) will ensure that boiler systems are designed within a reasonable factor of safety (ASHRAE 90.1 allows a 1.25 safety factor for heating and 1.15 for cooling). (Source:<a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2012/data/papers/0193-000128.pdf">Donnell 2012</a>)</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Will the manufacturer or supplier provide operations training and tune up the system?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Building operators/facility management staff need to understand the different features of the equipment and know how to operate it. Disregarding this critical piece of training can nullify the expected energy savings because the system will not be operated the way it was designed to be. The tune-up is another important step to ensure the equipment is operating as it was designed to.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Refer to the <a routerLink="../operation">operation and training</a> section of the central plant resource map for more details about the tune-up. Requesting operations training and a tune-up from the manufacturer in the RFP can help reduce post-installation inefficiencies due to poor operation.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Is redundancy in heating systems desired?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Due to potential damage caused by heating system downtime, consider selecting a boiler system that includes redundant components. This can also improve performance, if, for example, there are two (2) boilers, each of which is sized at 60% capacity. Loss of one boiler would allow the remaining system to maintain temperatures above critical levels. This also helps avoid oversizing a single boiler.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Does the boiler system generate steam?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For steam boiler systems, an important criterion in addition to capacity is the steam pressure required by the heating system, humidification system, or process. Typically, heating systems require low pressure steam (less than 15 psig).</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Will the entire heating distribution system be assessed as part of a boiler replacement?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Consideration should be given to the heat distribution system. Efficiency gains and cost savings can be made by modifications to the distribution system. With hydronic systems, pumping energy can be reduced by adding adjustable speed pumping systems with appropriate controls. Conversion from three-way valves with bypass to two-way valves will allow variable flow to maximize cost savings.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p><sup>+</sup> Although turndown ratios as high as 35:1 are available, turndown ratios of more than 10:1 can cause greater losses because of the significantly increased excess air level at low firing and the lack of condensation due to small delta T (Source: <a href="https://cee1.org/">CEE</a>).</p>

  <a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/alliances/hea_boilers_fs.pdf">Duke Raleigh Hospital</a>, Raleigh North Carolina<br>
  Duke Raleigh Hospital is a 260,782 ft<sup>2</sup> hospital that opened in 1978. With a goal to save water and energy, the hospital installed three high-efficiency boilers. The payback was about 13 months, which translated into a saving of ~$10,000 per month compared to the previous system.
