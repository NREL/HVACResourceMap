<h3>Efficient Centrifugal Pump Selection</h3>
<p>Selecting an energy-efficient centrifugal pump requires careful evaluation of the pump and system curves. In order to minimize pump energy consumption, it is best to select a pump such that the system curve intersects the pump curve within 20% of its best efficiency point. For a more detailed explanation and examples of pump selection, refer to the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/efficient_centrifug_pumps.pdf">Pumping Systems Tip Sheet #3, Select an Energy-Efficient Centrifugal Pump</a>, from the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Industrial Technologies Program.</p>

<h3>Variable Speed Drives on Pumps</h3>
<p>Existing hydronic systems often have three-way control valves that can be replaced with two-way control valves or have the bypass leg closed to allow reduced flow at reduced loads. It should be noted that this does not work on pneumatic control valves because it disables the ability of the valve actuator to handle any close-off pressure. In addition, some three-way valves may not function properly with the bypass leg closed if the open leg wasn't designed to close against higher pressure. Typically, pumps operate at less than 60% load for almost 80% of their operating hours. Because the power is proportional to the cube of the shaft speed (affinity laws), a small reduction in speed results in a significant reduction in power.

<p>Adding VFD to an existing motor requires:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using an inverter duty motor for high voltage applications</li>
  <li>Evaluating peak flow demand and annual load profile when comparing different pumping systems.</li>

<h3>Future Pump Capacity Increase Planning</h3>
<p>To avoid running the equipment at part load, the design should be such that it can be upgraded easily. Planning space for such additions is strongly recommended. For more details about planning for future capacity increases, refer to section 7.3.3., Plan for Future Capacity Increases, in Chapter 7, Pumps and Motors of <a href="https://pdfslide.net/documents/energy-related-best-practices-a-sourcebook-for-the-chemical-.html">Energy-Related Best Practices: A Sourcebook for the Chemical Industry</a> from Iowa State University.</p>
