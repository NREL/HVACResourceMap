<p class="lead">Effective cooling tower operation is achieved by paying close attention to the manufacturer's safety and operational guidelines. Safety considerations include providing safe access and fall protection during inspection and maintenance, locking out fan motor and condenser pumps during inspection, protecting workers from biological growth, and avoiding re-entry of discharge air.</p>

<p>Cooling tower operational considerations include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clearing debris from basin</li>
  <li>Filling basin to required water level with make-up water valve</li>
  <li>Balancing water flow to ensure maximum wetness of fill surface area</li>
  <li>Chemical treatment during startup and operation</li>
  <li>Checking fan to ensure it is rotating in the proper direction</li>
  <li>Setting appropriate blowdown rate</li>
  <li>Installing and monitoring conductivity controllers to ensure correct blowdown rate</li>
  <li>Keeping log of quantities of make-up and blowdown water to help identify leaks and unaccounted draw-offs.</li>
</ul>

<p>A periodic energy audit is a helpful tool to assess cooling tower performance. For detailed steps such as identifying the boundary for evaluation, site inspection, equipment energy measurement, calculation, and analysis, refer to <a href="https://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/morvayindustrial/supp/toolbox12.pdf">Toolbox 12: Cooling Towers</a>, from John Wiley & Sons.</p>
