<p>Thermal energy storage is a method of storing heating or cooling thermal energy by running equipment at off-peak hours. Ice, water, and phase change material are some commonly used storage media. Hot storage systems are most suitable for applications in which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peak total heating load of the facility is significantly higher than the average load</li>
  <li>Utility's electric rate structure has high demand charges, ratchet charges, or a significant difference between on-peak and off-peak rates</li>
  <li>Facility is considering expanding heating capacity </li>
  <li>An existing storage tank is available</li>
  <li>Redundancy in heating systems is needed to make up for short-term heating requirement.</li>
</ul>
