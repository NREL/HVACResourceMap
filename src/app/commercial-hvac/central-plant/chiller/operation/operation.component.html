<p>Proper operation of a chiller includes periodic maintenance and ongoing performance monitoring. Here are some steps to ensure efficient chiller operation.</p>

<h2>During the annual chiller inspection, check for:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Refrigerant and air leaks (check low-pressure systems for excess air and high-pressure systems for appropriate refrigerant levels)</li>
  <li>Compressor operating pressures</li>
  <li>Motor voltage and amps (look for increases in current draw)</li>
  <li>Issues with electrical starters, contactors, and relays</li>
  <li>Evaporator and condenser tube bundle cleanliness and integrity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance Indicators include:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Condenser and evaporator entering and leaving water temperature and flow</li>
  <li>Chiller load profile</li>
  <li>Chiller energy performance (kW/ton)</li>
  <li>Oil level and pressure.</li>
</ul>
