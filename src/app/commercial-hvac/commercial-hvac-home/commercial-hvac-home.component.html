<p class="lead">The HVAC Resource Map is an intuitive graphical interface that provides quick access to a broad array of quality information on operations and maintenance best practices and energy and water efficiency measures.</p>

<p>The resources cover the central plant, distribution systems, and zone systems. The primary audiences for this resource are facility managers, operations staff, and design engineers who want to improve central plant and distribution efficiency but don't have time to search for these resources.</p>

<p>This Resource Map does not duplicate guidance provided in codes and standards, and it should not be used in lieu of professional engineering services.</p>
