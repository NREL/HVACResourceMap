<p>Packaged heating and cooling systems come in various physical sizes and capacities to meet different space conditioning demands. Two common types are rooftop units (RTUs) which are among the most popular commercial HVAC systems and typically found on top of large, low-rise buildings such as supermarkets and warehouses, and packaged terminal air conditioners (PTACs) which are commonly located in the spaces they serve (e.g., hotels, apartments). Both offer a range of system options that can be configured to meet heating or cooling loads and achieve desired energy efficiency levels.</p>

        <p class="lead">NREL researchers help to improve and install rooftop units (RTUs), the most prevalent type of packaged heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in U.S. commercial buildings.</p>

        <p class="mt-3">RTUs are the most prevalent type of HVAC system in U.S. commercial buildings and typically have a 15- to 20-year lifespan. RTUs are a type of packaged unit in that all components are contained within a factory-sealed system that does not require field assembly. They are usually mounted on roofs and can deliver heating, cooling, and ventilation to a specific area or multiple zones via ductwork.</p>

        <p>RTUs most commonly provide cooling using refrigerants in a vapor compression cycle and heating via natural gas combustion in a furnace. There is also a growing demand for, and adoption of, <a href="/commercial-hvac/cooling-heating/heat-pump">Heat Pumps RTUs</a>. These systems provide both heating and cooling using the same technology as an air conditioner, but they have the addition of a reversing valve and corresponding control and firmware changes. These may or may not be dual fuel capable. Dual fuel or hybrid systems retain the ability to heat using a fossil fuel, typically natural gas, in the same manner that conventional RTUs are designed while also being able to provide electrical heating as a heat pump.</p>

        <p>RTUs are highly customizable, and it is beneficial to work with a design engineer to determine the best options for your building or portfolio. Further customization can be made in close collaboration with a manufacturer, but some common RTU features are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cooling capacity &lpar;measured in tons and usually the main feature that characterizes an RTU&rpar;</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Typical capacities range from 5&ndash;100 tons</li>
            <li>Defined at rated conditions&mdash;capacity may be reduced at elevated temperatures</li>
            <li>Should be based on building load calculations, not just matching the capacity of existing equipment</li>
          </ul>

          <li>Dehumidification type</li>
          <li>Filtration type</li>
          <li>Energy recovery</li>
          <li>Coil options</li>
          <li>Electrical power options</li>
          <li>Controller type</li>

          <li>Coating additions &lpar;to improve resistance to corrosion or degradation from ultraviolet &lbrack;UV&rbrack; rays&rpar;.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether an RTU is newly installed or an existing unit that has been upgraded, it requires commissioning to ensure that it is working as intended and has an established operating baseline. During regular operation, routine maintenance can identify issues early and help the unit avoid performance degradation or potential failure. The requirements and procedures for these processes can vary depending on the manufacturer, equipment size, owner expectations, and other factors, so it is important to determine the needs of each system.</p>

        <h3>Procurement and Planning</h3>
        <h4>Motivations</h4>

        <p>RTUs are among the most widely used commercial HVAC systems. Performance and longevity are well understood as are operation and maintenance. The ubiquity of these systems leads to a variety of motivations for replacement, ranging from lowering operating costs to improving indoor air quality to planned retirement of older units as an alternative to expensive repairs. Corporate sustainability goals and changing building use may also necessitate replacement. Utility incentives or local/state requirements (e.g., the phase out of refrigerants with high global warming potential) may also play a role. The most common reasons are likely to be the need to replace equipment that are near or at the end of their life and require immediate repair or to upgrade an older unit to reduce operational cost and improve space thermal comfort. </p>

        <p>There are often multiple units per building, which can reduce the resistance to the introduction of advanced products as the costs are phased in and the risk can be spread across the units. For example, if there are 10 RTUs mounted on a building, a new technology, such as a heat pump or hybrid system, may be installed during replacement of one unit. If performance is satisfactory, this can be applied to other units as they are replaced. This reduces technical risk as well as spreading out capital expenditures in a way that is often not feasible with centralized systems. </p>

        <h4>System Needs</h4>
        <p>System requirements need to be determined before selecting equipment. A building owner or operator should first consider if both cooling and heating are necessary and the capacity and efficiency of the unit(s). Often systems are replaced “like for like” as this is the simplest solution, but this can lead to reduced performance. Existing systems are frequently oversized, leading to increased cycling, lower efficiency, and reduced equipment lifetime. A more appropriate approach is to understand the current and expected loads on the system, including how they may have changed over time along with building use changes or efficiency upgrades. Additionally, comfort or air-quality concerns may affect how an owner selects equipment.  </p>

        <h4>Performance</h4>
        <p>The next question is whether the existing system meets all operational and business requirements. If not, what is the shortcoming? Is it efficiency, capacity, or fuel type? Or perhaps it’s the initial cost or maintenance costs? If the performance is adequate, that is a good starting point, but it is not the end point, because future needs (i.e., changing utility rate structures, applicable regulations, and business goals) may change.</p>

        <p>Anticipated future changes in the business operating environment are important considerations for equipment that could last 20 years or more. Is a heat pump a potential option? In many climates in the United States, a heat pump can provide year-round conditioning while avoiding the emission of direct greenhouse gases. In colder climates, heat pumps can reduce heating costs in mild to moderately cold temperatures. When dual fuel systems are used, not only can annual heating energy costs decline, but resilience can also increase with two sources of heating readily available. RTUs can be a great platform for this purpose because they can be introduced gradually. This allows operators and owners to familiarize themselves with the new technology without having to convert the entire building at one time. </p>

        <p>Other considerations could be changes in building use or configuration that may require additional capacity. This may include future building expansions that could be served by a particular unit if it has sufficient capacity.</p>

        <h4>System Options</h4>
        <img src="assets/images/rooftop_unit_terminal-units.jpg" class="lead-img" alt="Illustration of RTU unit showing connected ductwork and terminal units.">
        <p class="caption">
          <strong>Illustration of cross-section of an RTU with ductwork and VAV terminal units for conditioned air supply/return </strong> Illustration by Marjorie Schott, NREL
        </p>

        <p>The primary systems available vary by capacity, efficiency, and heating system. </p>
        <p>Owners may be interested in increasing the capacity of their RTU, especially if building use is changing or there is a smaller addition to the building. This can be problematic as adding units to the roof leads to increased weight, which may not be feasible without structural enhancements to the building. If capacity is increased beyond necessity, it may cause short cycling of the equipment, reducing efficiency and increasing maintenance. Ductwork may also need to be appropriately resized for larger-capacity systems. Improving the efficiency may lower the operational costs; more efficient RTUs provide the same conditioning capacity while consuming less energy. If electrical capacity is constrained, a more efficient unit may allow for cooling and heating capacity upgrades without electrical upgrades. However, there may be structural or material cost considerations that make this option less appropriate. The primary heating system is typically natural gas, though options for a heat pump with a natural gas backup are available as of 2024.</p>

        <h4>Associated Systems</h4>
        <h5>Roof/Structure</h5>
        <p>RTUs add a substantial amount of weight to roofs. Any additional weight from a unit upgrade related to increased efficiency, energy storage, or additional capacity, for example, will require an engineer to approve of the additional weight and possibly require structural enhancement.</p>
        <h5>Electric</h5>
        <p>This is one of the primary considerations for RTU upgrades. Installing a new heat pump may require additional electrical capacity. Depending on how much capacity the circuit and/or building has, this could be a major expense to upgrade in addition to the cost of the unit. In colder climates, the electric resistance backup heating capacity is often the largest contributor to the additional capacity. One remedy is to consider a hybrid system such that, if needed, the system can heat using natural gas, thus eliminating the need for backup heat and allowing the heat pump to be sized to meet the cooling load rather than the heating load. The electrical requirements will not change substantially from the existing unit. In addition, newer units are typically higher efficiency than existing units, further reducing electrical capacity needs and providing for additional flexibility elsewhere in the building. </p>
        <h5>Condensate</h5>
        <p>If a heat pump is installed there will be condensate in cold weather due to the defrost cycle. This has two implications. The first is that it is possible for the condensate to freeze, unlike condensate during warm seasons, which could form ice dams or lead to other bulk water penetration if not properly routed away from the building. The second is that a drain pan heater will be required as part of the condensate strategy, which is effectively an electric resistance heater that prevents condensate from freezing in the unit. From an electrical capacity viewpoint, this is similar to a small electric resistance backup heater and must be accounted for during electrical capacity calculations.</p>
        <h5>Controls and Building Automation System</h5>
        <p>If a heat pump is installed, part of the commissioning process will require interfacing with the building automation system (BAS). The units will determine which heating system to use. BAS and/or installer defaults may not provide cost-optimal performance. Often the switchover setpoints that a BAS or installer may choose are overly conservative and/or do not account for local utility rate structures.</p>
        <h5>Alternatives to Standard Units</h5>
        <p>In buildings that already have RTUs, the most economical replacement system is almost always another RTU. Exceptions may occur if building additions or substantial remodeling or demolition work are anticipated. Variable refrigerant flow technologies are common alternative systems to RTUs, but they likely require a dedicated outdoor-air system for ventilation and are more prone to refrigerant leakage, which requires additional maintenance. Some designers also opt for a chiller or boiler system.</p>

        <h4>Procurement</h4>
        <p>System needs and options can be written into a request for proposal (RFP), a document that describes a project and solicits bids from contractors. The content of an RFP is similar whether the request is for a new RTU or unit maintenance. It typically includes the scope of work to be completed, details on the equipment requirements or minimum service to be provided, contract period and renewals, and RTU pricing or method and quantity of awards. In some instances, bidders may be asked additional questions based on specific building owner or operator needs.</p>

        <h4>Building Impacts</h4>
        <p>RTU replacement typically impacts building operations less than replacing centralized HVAC systems because most of the system is located outside of occupied areas and is relatively easy. If a building has multiple RTUs and one unit is offline, the building may be able to function reasonably well, albeit with reduced comfort in the zone serviced by the offline RTU. Depending on the building and ducting configuration, this may or may not have an outsized impact on business operations. A crane is usually required for installation, which can be disruptive depending on the space available on the ground for the crane.</p>

        <h3>Examples from the Field</h3>
        <p>Case studies developed as part of the Advanced RTU Campaign can be found on the <a href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/advanced-rtu-case-studies">U.S. Department of Energy&apos;s Better Buildings website</a>. They cover a variety of building types and business cases with a focus on reducing operating costs. These studies showcase a variety of successful commercial applications that demonstrate the feasibility and performance of highly efficient RTU products on the market today. </p>

        <h3>Financial Resources</h3>
        <p>Many forms of financial incentives exist at local, state, and federal levels to support the adoption of more energy efficient RTUs. Resources, such as the U.S. Department of Energy&apos;s Better Buildings&apos; <a href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/sites/default/files/tools/RTU_incentive_database_Spring_2020.xlsx">RTU Incentives Database</a>, <a href="https://www.dsireusa.org">DSIRE</a>, the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans">U.S. Small Business Administration&apos;s loans</a>, and the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/femp/energy-savings-performance-contract-enable-federal-projects">Federal Energy Management Program&apos;s energy savings contracting team</a> can provide tools for the transition.</p>

        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <p>RTUs are the most prevalent type of commercial space conditioning systems. They are self-contained, typically perform both heating and cooling, and often are used in conjunction with other RTUs on the same building. The high-volume production and availability of RTUs mean that there are more options to choose from when upgrading relative to more customized systems. These features make RTUs ideal candidates for low-risk upgrades to reduce operating costs and/or improve operating resilience and redundancy. The packaged nature of these systems means that even higher efficiency and dual fuel designs can be drop-in replacements for existing units, reducing or eliminating additional installation cost premiums while still providing substantial operational benefits.</p>

        <p>Packaged terminal air conditioners &lpar;PTACs&rpar; are self-contained HVAC systems that deliver heating, cooling, and ventilation to a conditioned space. All key components—such as evaporator, condenser, fan, and heater—are housed within a single unit. These units differ in their primary heating and cooling system &lpar;electric-resistance heating or heat pump&rpar; and their mounting configuration &lpar;horizontal or vertical&rpar;.</p>
        <p>PTACs are typically installed horizontally through an exterior wall—often under a window—and do not require ductwork since they are located directly in the space they serve. These units are housed in a wall sleeve and include an exterior grille for the outdoor coil and, if applicable, ventilation air intake.</p>

        </p>
        </div>
        <p>Vertical terminal air conditioners &lpar;VTACs&rpar;, also known as single packaged vertical air conditioners &lpar;SPVACs&rpar;, are mounted in a small equipment closet on an exterior wall and are used when the heating and cooling unit needs to be concealed. They can be ducted to distribute air more evenly throughout a room or to multiple spaces, and access is usually via a panel with a return grille in the wall of the closet. A penetration through the exterior wall is required to provide airflow to the outdoor coil and, if included, to introduce ventilation air. Both PTACs and VTACs use electric-resistance heating and direct expansion cooling for space conditioning but can also be designed to use a heat pump to meet heating and cooling demand.</p>

        <p>PTACs, VTACs, and their heat pump alternatives (packaged terminal heat pumps [PTHPs], vertical terminal heat pumps [VTHPs]) have a lot in common. They are similar in size, require a wall sleeve, a refrigerant circuit, optional outdoor air ventilation, and an electrical connection. </p>
        <p>They offer a complete solution for heating, cooling, and ventilating a single space. These systems are primarily used where cost is an issue and individual space temperature control is required — for example, in multifamily apartment buildings, student housing, assisted living facilities, and hotels. Packaged terminal systems offer a moderate degree of customization depending on electrical, space, or capacity requirements, and generally have the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Electrical connections
                <ul>
                    <li>Typically 208V/230V or 265V single phase and varies from 15&hyphen;30 minimum circuit ampacity </li>
                    <li>Can come hardwired or with a receptacle plug &lpar;NEMA6 for 230V or NEMA7 for 265V&rpar;</li>
                    <li>If hardwired, they require a disconnect, which may be offered by the manufacturer as part of a hardwire kit. For this reason, many owners prefer to use a wall plug, which does not require a separate disconnect.</li>

            </li>
            <li>Heating and cooling</li>

                    <li>Heat pump models often include a supplemental electric-resistance coil</li>

        <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
        <h4>Controls</h4>
        <p>Standard PTAC controls include manual unit-mounted temperature and fan controls, although manufacturers and many third-party suppliers offer options for wall-mounted thermostat and fan controls. In most cases, the control is a direct electronic type without networking, building automation system &lpar;BAS&rpar; integration, or internet connectivity. There are many options for connected controls, including wired and wireless BACnet, and proprietary controls. Wireless controllers can use infrared, Wi-Fi, or a Zigbee wireless mesh for communication. BACnet systems require a centrally located supervisory controller that serves multiple rooms. Often, one controller per floor is sufficient, but larger buildings with multiple wings may require additional supervisory controllers.</p>
        <p>For hotel applications, some control systems can be integrated into the property management system and reception management software.</p>
        <h4>Energy Performance</h4>
        <p>PTACs have several energy-saving options. Design engineers can identify measures such as temperature setpoint resets, schedules, occupancy sensors, the use of dedicated outdoor air systems, or other features that can provide energy and cost savings.</p>
        <p>Options for increased energy savings that do not require additional controls include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Properly size unit for expected heating or cooling demand</li>
            <li>Select high efficiency systems &lpar;i.e., high energy efficiency ratio and coefficient of performance&rpar;</li>
            <li>Consider a unit with a variable-speed compressor and multispeed or variable-speed fan motors</li>
            <li>Ensure proper unit installation
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure exterior wall penetration is properly sealed</li>
                    <li>Avoid obstructing supply or return grilles</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Perform regular maintenance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Procurement and Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Indoor packaged units are often used because they have a low upfront cost, are self-contained, and easy to install. The simplicity of these systems streamlines the procurement and maintenance processes. Prior to procurement, determine the heating and cooling loads of the space to be conditioned, as well as electrical and structural limitations. The ASHRAE <i>Load Calculations Application Manual</i> or the ACCA <i>Manual N&mdash;Commercial Load Calculation</i> provide detailed steps for determining heating and cooling loads. If you are replacing a system and have determined the required loads, consider selecting a unit that meets both the space heating and cooling demand as well as the same electrical requirements and dimensions so that the existing grille and sleeve can be reused. Qualifying units can be procured wholesale or through a retailer.</p>
        <p>or newly installed packaged units, commissioning may be required or advisable to ensure that the system functions as designed. During normal operation, proper maintenance of PTAC equipment provides many benefits, such as proper equipment operation, energy and cost savings, longer equipment life, and occupant comfort. Preventative maintenance practices can vary depending on the manufacturer, type of PTAC, age of the system, and location. However, there are some best practices that are common to most units.</p>

        <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
        <p>There are many factors that must be considered with terminal air conditioning or heat pump systems. The most common factors are explained in detail above. Below are additional considerations for packaged systems:</p>
        <h4>Cooling Coil Condensate</h4>
        <p>Cooling coils can produce condensate that needs to be drained. The traditional method of draining condensate is to allow the condensate to drip down the outside wall of the building, which can result in dirt streaks and stains on the building envelope.</p>
        <p>The new standard method of condensate control in packaged units uses a device called a slinger ring to spray the condensate from the drain pan onto the outdoor coil. This not only eliminates the problem of condensate dripping down the exterior of the building, but also increases the efficiency of the cooling system through evaporative cooling at the condensing coil.</p>
        <p>An alternative, but uncommon, method is a fully piped condensate system that pipes the condensate from each PTAC to the building&#39;s storm drain system. This condensate removal option carries a very large first cost, and also introduces a construction issue and potential freezing issue with plumbing located in the exterior wall of the building.</p>
        <h4>Noise</h4>
        <p>The noise generated by packaged terminal units can negatively impact occupant comfort. VTACs and VTHPs are a quieter alternative than PTACs/PTHPs because they are located in a closet and have a ducted supply air distributor, but they require higher upfront costs. Manufacturers have introduced several options for mitigating the noise in packaged units, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quieter fan and compressor motors</li>
          <li>Sound-insulated fan and compressor cabinets.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sea Coast Salt Protection</h4>
        <p>For installations within 20 miles of a saltwater body, it is strongly recommended to specify equipment with sea-coast corrosion protection to prevent premature failure. This protection typically involves applying epoxy or polymer coatings to components exposed to outdoor air—most notably the heating and cooling coils—and is validated through salt spray testing in accordance with ASTM B117. These protective measures are not always part of standard manufacturer offerings and may require customization or coordination with a third-party coating provider.</p>
        <h4>Refrigerants</h4>
        <p>R-410A was the most common refrigerant for these systems but is being phased out starting in 2025. R-32 and R-454B are emerging next-generation refrigerants currently offered by all major terminal air conditioning manufacturers.</p>
