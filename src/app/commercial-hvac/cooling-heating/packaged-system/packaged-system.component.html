<p class="lead">NREL researchers help to improve and install rooftop units (RTUs), the most prevalent type of packaged heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in U.S. commercial buildings.</p>

<p class="mt-3">RTUs are the most prevalent type of HVAC system in U.S. commercial buildings and typically have a 15- to 20-year lifespan. RTUs are a type of packaged unit in that all components are contained within a factory-sealed system that does not require field assembly. They are usually mounted on roofs and can deliver heating, cooling, and ventilation to a specific area or multiple zones via ductwork.</p>

<p>RTUs most commonly provide cooling using refrigerants in a vapor compression cycle and heating via natural gas combustion in a furnace. There is also a growing demand for, and adoption of, <a routerLink="/commercial-hvac/cooling-heating/heat-pump" aria-hidden="true">heat pump RTUs</a>. These systems provide both heating and cooling using the same technology as an air conditioner, but they have the addition of a reversing valve and corresponding control and firmware changes. These may or may not be dual fuel capable. Dual fuel or hybrid systems retain the ability to heat using a fossil fuel, typically natural gas, in the same manner that conventional RTUs are designed while also being able to provide electrical heating as a heat pump.</p>
<p>RTUs are highly customizable, and it is beneficial to work with a design engineer to determine the best options for your building or portfolio. Further customization can be made in close collaboration with a manufacturer, but some common RTU features are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cooling capacity &lpar;measured in tons and usually the main feature that characterizes an RTU&rpar;</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Typical capacities range from 5&ndash;100 tons</li>
        <li>Defined at rated conditions&mdash;capacity may be reduced at elevated temperatures</li>
        <li>Should be based on building load calculations, not just matching the capacity of existing equipment</li>
    </ul>

    </li>
    <li>

    <li>
       Dehumidification type
    </li>
    <li>Filtration type</li>

</ul>

<p>Whether an RTU is newly installed or an existing unit that has been upgraded, it requires commissioning to ensure that it is working as intended and has an established operating baseline. During regular operation, routine maintenance can identify issues early and help the unit avoid performance degradation or potential failure. The requirements and procedures for these processes can vary depending on the manufacturer, equipment size, owner expectations, and other factors, so it is important to determine the needs of each system.</p>

<h2>Procurement and Planning</h2>
<h3>Motivations</h3>

<p>RTUs are among the most widely used commercial HVAC systems. Performance and longevity are well understood as are operation and maintenance. The ubiquity of these systems leads to a variety of motivations for replacement, ranging from lowering operating costs to improving indoor air quality to planned retirement of older units as an alternative to expensive repairs. Corporate sustainability goals and changing building use may also necessitate replacement. Utility incentives or local/state requirements (e.g., the phase out of refrigerants with high global warming potential) may also play a role. The most common reasons are likely to be the need to replace equipment that are near or at the end of their life and require immediate repair or to upgrade an older unit to reduce operational cost and improve space thermal comfort. </p>

<p>There are often multiple units per building, which can reduce the resistance to the introduction of advanced products as the costs are phased in and the risk can be spread across the units. For example, if there are 10 RTUs mounted on a building, a new technology, such as a heat pump or hybrid system, may be installed during replacement of one unit. If performance is satisfactory, this can be applied to other units as they are replaced. This reduces technical risk as well as spreading out capital expenditures in a way that is often not feasible with centralized systems. </p>

<h3>System Needs</h3>
<p>System requirements need to be determined before selecting equipment. A building owner or operator should first consider if both cooling and heating are necessary and the capacity and efficiency of the unit(s). Often systems are replaced “like for like” as this is the simplest solution, but this can lead to reduced performance. Existing systems are frequently oversized, leading to increased cycling, lower efficiency, and reduced equipment lifetime. A more appropriate approach is to understand the current and expected loads on the system, including how they may have changed over time along with building use changes or efficiency upgrades. Additionally, comfort or air-quality concerns may affect how an owner selects equipment.  </p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The next question is whether the existing system meets all operational and business requirements. If not, what is the shortcoming? Is it efficiency, capacity, or fuel type? Or perhaps it’s the initial cost or maintenance costs? If the performance is adequate, that is a good starting point, but it is not the end point, because future needs (i.e., changing utility rate structures, applicable regulations, and business goals) may change.</p>

<p>Anticipated future changes in the business operating environment are important considerations for equipment that could last 20 years or more. Is a heat pump a potential option? In many climates in the United States, a heat pump can provide year-round conditioning while avoiding the emission of direct greenhouse gases. In colder climates, heat pumps can reduce heating costs in mild to moderately cold temperatures. When dual fuel systems are used, not only can annual heating energy costs decline, but resilience can also increase with two sources of heating readily available. RTUs can be a great platform for this purpose because they can be introduced gradually. This allows operators and owners to familiarize themselves with the new technology without having to convert the entire building at one time. </p>

<p>Other considerations could be changes in building use or configuration that may require additional capacity. This may include future building expansions that could be served by a particular unit if it has sufficient capacity.</p>

<h3>System Options</h3>

<p class="caption">

</p>

<p>The primary systems available vary by capacity, efficiency, and heating system. </p>
<p>Owners may be interested in increasing the capacity of their RTU, especially if building use is changing or there is a smaller addition to the building. This can be problematic as adding units to the roof leads to increased weight, which may not be feasible without structural enhancements to the building. If capacity is increased beyond necessity, it may cause short cycling of the equipment, reducing efficiency and increasing maintenance. Ductwork may also need to be appropriately resized for larger-capacity systems. Improving the efficiency may lower the operational costs; more efficient RTUs provide the same conditioning capacity while consuming less energy. If electrical capacity is constrained, a more efficient unit may allow for cooling and heating capacity upgrades without electrical upgrades. However, there may be structural or material cost considerations that make this option less appropriate. The primary heating system is typically natural gas, though options for a heat pump with a natural gas backup are available as of 2024.</p>

<h3>Associated Systems</h3>
<h4>Roof/Structure</h4>
<p>RTUs add a substantial amount of weight to roofs. Any additional weight from a unit upgrade related to increased efficiency, energy storage, or additional capacity, for example, will require an engineer to approve of the additional weight and possibly require structural enhancement.</p>
<h4>Electric</h4>
<p>This is one of the primary considerations for RTU upgrades. Installing a new heat pump may require additional electrical capacity. Depending on how much capacity the circuit and/or building has, this could be a major expense to upgrade in addition to the cost of the unit. In colder climates, the electric resistance backup heating capacity is often the largest contributor to the additional capacity. One remedy is to consider a hybrid system such that, if needed, the system can heat using natural gas, thus eliminating the need for backup heat and allowing the heat pump to be sized to meet the cooling load rather than the heating load. The electrical requirements will not change substantially from the existing unit. In addition, newer units are typically higher efficiency than existing units, further reducing electrical capacity needs and providing for additional flexibility elsewhere in the building. </p>
<h4>Condensate</h4>
<p>If a heat pump is installed there will be condensate in cold weather due to the defrost cycle. This has two implications. The first is that it is possible for the condensate to freeze, unlike condensate during warm seasons, which could form ice dams or lead to other bulk water penetration if not properly routed away from the building. The second is that a drain pan heater will be required as part of the condensate strategy, which is effectively an electric resistance heater that prevents condensate from freezing in the unit. From an electrical capacity viewpoint, this is similar to a small electric resistance backup heater and must be accounted for during electrical capacity calculations.</p>
<h4>Controls and Building Automation System</h4>
<p>If a heat pump is installed, part of the commissioning process will require interfacing with the building automation system (BAS). The units will determine which heating system to use. BAS and/or installer defaults may not provide cost-optimal performance. Often the switchover setpoints that a BAS or installer may choose are overly conservative and/or do not account for local utility rate structures.</p>
<h4>Alternatives to Standard Units</h4>
<p>In buildings that already have RTUs, the most economical replacement system is almost always another RTU. Exceptions may occur if building additions or substantial remodeling or demolition work are anticipated. Variable refrigerant flow technologies are common alternative systems to RTUs, but they likely require a dedicated outdoor-air system for ventilation and are more prone to refrigerant leakage, which requires additional maintenance. Some designers also opt for a chiller or boiler system.</p>

<h3>Procurement</h3>
<p>System needs and options can be written into a request for proposal (RFP), a document that describes a project and solicits bids from contractors. The content of an RFP is similar whether the request is for a new RTU or unit maintenance. It typically includes the scope of work to be completed, details on the equipment requirements or minimum service to be provided, contract period and renewals, and RTU pricing or method and quantity of awards. In some instances, bidders may be asked additional questions based on specific building owner or operator needs.</p>

<h3>Building Impacts</h3>
<p>RTU replacement typically impacts building operations less than replacing centralized HVAC systems because most of the system is located outside of occupied areas and is relatively easy. If a building has multiple RTUs and one unit is offline, the building may be able to function reasonably well, albeit with reduced comfort in the zone serviced by the offline RTU. Depending on the building and ducting configuration, this may or may not have an outsized impact on business operations. A crane is usually required for installation, which can be disruptive depending on the space available on the ground for the crane.</p>

<h2>Examples from the Field</h2>
<p>Case studies developed as part of the Advanced RTU Campaign can be found on the <a href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/advanced-rtu-case-studies">U.S. Department of Energy&apos;s Better Buildings website</a>. They cover a variety of building types and business cases with a focus on reducing operating costs. These studies showcase a variety of successful commercial applications that demonstrate the feasibility and performance of highly efficient RTU products on the market today. </p>

<h2>Financial Resources</h2>
<p>Many forms of financial incentives exist at local, state, and federal levels to support the adoption of more energy efficient RTUs. Resources, such as the U.S. Department of Energy&apos;s Better Buildings&apos; <a href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/sites/default/files/tools/RTU_incentive_database_Spring_2020.xlsx">RTU Incentives Database</a>, <a href="https://www.dsireusa.org">DSIRE</a>, the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans">U.S. Small Business Administration&apos;s loans</a>, and the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/femp/energy-savings-performance-contract-enable-federal-projects">Federal Energy Management Program&apos;s energy savings contracting team</a> can provide tools for the transition.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>RTUs are the most prevalent type of commercial space conditioning systems. They are self-contained, typically perform both heating and cooling, and often are used in conjunction with other RTUs on the same building. The high-volume production and availability of RTUs mean that there are more options to choose from when upgrading relative to more customized systems. These features make RTUs ideal candidates for low-risk upgrades to reduce operating costs and/or improve operating resilience and redundancy. The packaged nature of these systems means that even higher efficiency and dual fuel designs can be drop-in replacements for existing units, reducing or eliminating additional installation cost premiums while still providing substantial operational benefits.</p>
