<p>Laboratories present unique requirements for both high-volume and low-velocity supply air to provide a safe working environment for occupants. To achieve this high ventilation effectiveness, special considerations in selecting, locating, and sizing supply air equipment are required.</p>

<h2>Selection of Equipment</h2>

<p>Laminar-flow distribution systems should be used to achieve high-volume and low-velocity supply air requirements in laboratories. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Perforated duct</li>
  <li>Perforated diffusers</li>
  <li>Perforated ceiling panels</li>
  <li>High-capacity radial</li>
</ul>

<h2>Location and Sizing of Equipment</h2>
<p>Diffusers should be located far from exposure control devices (ECDs) and supply air should sweep across the lab without creating excessive air currents that could compromise containments by ECDs, such as fume hoods and snorkels. The ratio of the diffuser's throw where velocity is greater than 50 fpm (0.25 m/s), T<sub>50</sub>, and characteristic length, L, unique to each diffuser type, should be taken into consideration when locating and sizing equipment. For all diffusers, a T<sub>50</sub>/L greater than 1.0 results in the throw exceeding the recommended supply air velocities.</p>

<p>It is recommended that the maximum supply air velocity within the occupied space (7ft from floor) is 50% of the fume hood face velocity required to maintain containment<sup>2</sup>. Within the immediate vicinity of the hood, it is preferred that supply air velocity should be no more than 20% of required fume hood face velocity<sup>3</sup>. Examples of recommended air velocities are provided in Table 2.</p>
