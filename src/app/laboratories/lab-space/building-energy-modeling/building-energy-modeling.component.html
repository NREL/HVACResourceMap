<p>Lab spaces are subject to strict ventilation requirements and have complex HVAC systems and process loads, making it difficult to determine how various system components impact overall energy performance.</p>

<p>Whether benchmarking an existing building to identify improvements or comparing design alternatives for new construction, building energy modeling provides helpful insight into how energy is used throughout a building. Useful metrics – both at the whole-building level and specific end-use-type level – allow lab owners, managers, and designers to visualize the effects of each component on total energy consumption. Though labs often require detailed work to accurately represent complex features in an energy model, doing so can help inform decision making to best optimize cost, safety, and performance.</p>

<p>For new construction, energy modeling for buildings early in the design stage is an important step for achieving an integrated high-performance design. Lab buildings vary greatly in terms of load, operating hours, ventilation requirements, and other conditions, making it difficult to formulate related assumptions necessary for the energy model. Furthermore, lab buildings, especially in academic settings, are often subject to change, sometimes complicating initial assumptions. However, the building energy model can be used to predict energy performance under a broad range of assumptions, allowing lab stakeholders to ensure lab building systems have the capacity to meet requirements in the event of change.</p>

<p>Important Note: In the context of any building type, results from building energy models should be interpreted with consideration of the degree of certainty surrounding input to the model. </p>
