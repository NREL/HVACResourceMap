<p>Air is the primary carrier of heat, moisture, and contaminants in and around laboratory buildings. Airflow patterns play an important role in determining the air velocities, air temperatures, and concentration of contaminants which subsequently determine thermal comfort of occupants and indoor air quality in laboratories. However, there are no easy means available to visualize airflow patterns. The flow path of air and the resulting flow path of contaminants can depend on several inter-related factors including the supply airflow rate or air changes per hour (ACH); in the case of ventilation dominated laboratories the contaminant generation rates and their location and type of contaminants; location, number, and type of supply diffusers; number and locations of exhaust grilles and returns; in the case of cooling load dominated laboratories the location and strength of various heat sources; in the case of fume hood dominated ventilation the location and size of fume hoods; and finally the arrangement of furniture and other airflow obstructions. In general, clean supply air should sweep the contaminants without short circuiting the space and the contaminated air should effectively exit the space without significant recirculation and stagnation. Thus, optimizing the flow path of supply and contaminated air can help in improving the ventilation effectiveness which can lead to safe, energy efficient laboratories.</p>

<p>The airflow rate and the resulting flow of contaminants can depend on several of the following factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supply airflow rate or air changes per hour (ACH)</li>
  <li>Contaminant generation rates and their location and type of contaminants</li>
  <li>Location, number, and type of supply diffusers; number and locations of exhaust grilles and returns</li>
  <li>In cooling climates, the location and strength of various heat sources</li>
  <li>The location and size of fume hoods in fume hood dominated labs</li>
  <li>The arrangement of furniture and other airflow obstructions</li>
</ul>

<p>To find out how the introduction of a new component such as a diffuser in the space can alter the ventilation effectiveness of a laboratory space without conducting expensive experimental testing, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis can be used. By inputting diffuser type and location, return grill types and location, exhaust airflows, workspace, and scientific personnel locations into a three-dimensional model, a visualization and optimization of the ventilation system can be achieved.</p>
