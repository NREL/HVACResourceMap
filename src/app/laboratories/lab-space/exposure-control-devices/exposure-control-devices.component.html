<p>Exposure control devices contain the hazardous chemical in the laboratory environment at the source. Fume hoods are a primary method of exposure control and are defined as "a safety device specifically designed to carry undesirable effluence away from laboratory personnel and out of the building, when connected to a properly designed laboratory system" according to the Scientific Equipment and Furniture Association (SEFA) (ASHRAE 2015).</p>

<p>Fume hoods are typically the most visible component of a laboratory HVAC system. Knowing how to optimally use these devices with the ventilation system for proper temperature control, dilution and chemical isolation is a fundamental part of lab energy conservation. A solid knowledge of fume hoods and their features, limitations, and design and operational requirements is critical for a sound design and operation of laboratory HVAC systems.</p>

<p>Exposure control devices are divided into three general categories for specific use: chemical fumes, biological substances, and other uses.</p>
<h2>Chemical Fume Hoods</h2>
<p>Chemical fume hoods are designed to contain general odorous, toxic and otherwise harmful chemical substances that are used in a wide range of laboratory activities pertaining to chemical research. These designs exhaust the air to outside the building without needing to purify the air.</p>

<h3>Fume Hood Hibernation</h3>
<p>In high performance laboratory operations, optimizing energy efficiency and savings is crucial. Fume hoods can place tremendous pressure on a HVAC system due to the energy needed to maintain safe air flow rates. Operational costs per fume hood can be equivalent to the average energy used by three U.S. homes (Harvard University). However, there are periods when these fume hoods remain unused, leading to unnecessary energy expenditure.</p>
<p>A current method, adopted by various laboratories, intended to reduce energy usage is fume hood hibernation. Cornell University defines fume hood hibernation as “the temporary shutdown of a fume hood, including the rebalancing supply ventilation and pressurization of the laboratory room”. This allows for laboratory ventilation reduction while still allowing occupants to continue working. Before applying this procedure, it is important to assess laboratory needs and operations to understand technical and mechanical limitations along with regulatory requirements. While hibernating fume hoods leads to energy reduction, maintaining safety and health of laboratory users is a top priority in the hibernation process. During the implementation of fume hood hibernation and other ventilation system optimization strategies, providing comprehensive training for laboratory professionals is essential. This training not only ensures the effective maintenance and inspection of ventilation systems but also reinforces safety protocols and educates personnel about chemical exposure risks.</p>
<p>Fume Hood Hibernation Shutdown Steps (by Cornell University):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Obtain and wear proper PPE, including safety glasses when working in the lab.</li>
    <li>Survey lab ventilation system for other exhaust sources. If general exhaust, point exhaust or other hoods are not present, hood flow can only be reduced enough to provide exhaust flow for required air changes.</li>
    <li>Confirm that all chemicals and equipment have been removed from hood. If this is not completed then inform the lab occupants, building coordinator or EHS that this job task cannot be completed until this is done.</li>
    <li>Take air flow readings, calculate and record air change rate, before and after hibernating or reducing hood flow.</li>
    <li>Perform proper steps to decommission hood:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hoods not connected to common header</strong>:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Secure exhaust fan and damper and install lock out tag out if exhaust fan is to be turned off.</li>
        <li>Secure VAV and make necessary adjustments to mechanical components and/or controls.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Place “Do Not Use” sign on sash and physically secure sash closed if requested by facility management.</li>
    <li>Take pressure/flow reading to make certain space is properly balanced and pressurization is correct. Note: If reheat is the only heat source, supply air may have to be increased.</li>
    <li>Have BAS graphics edited to show fume hood in hibernation.</li>
    <li>Check BAS for alarms generated and have them temporarily taken out of service or tagged to be ignored.</li>
    <li>Place tag on VAV and fan indicating that the fume hood is in vacant mode. </li>
    <li>Notify appropriate personnel (Building coordinator, General foreperson ECCO group, ECCO Manager) that hibernation sequence has been completed.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>To perform un-hibernation</strong>: Perform process in reverse. Confirm face velocity and negative pressurization of room following steps to return equipment to operation.</p>

        <p>Fume hood hibernation represents a strategy for enhancing energy efficiency in laboratory operations, specifically looking at exposure control devices and ventilation systems. During periods of low activity control systems and advanced sensing technologies can contribute to cost savings and minimize energy waste. With careful planning, implementation, and ongoing monitoring, fume hood hibernation can become an integral component of a comprehensive energy management strategy for research facilities.

        <h2>Biological Safety Cabinets</h2>
<p>Biological safety cabinets (BSC) are needed to provide a more secure environment so these cabinets are designed to specifically handle organisms, infectious agents, processes, and particles that can potentially contaminate and harm other projects, personnel, and the environment. Because air needs to be purified when exiting or even entering the BSC, a HEPA filter needs to be installed at the biological safety cabinet. There are several types of BSC and the type selected has significant energy implications.</p>

</p>

<p>In addition to chemical fume hoods and biological safety cabinets, there are numerous other types of primary containment devices that are available to control airborne containments in laboratories, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ventilated balance enclosures</li>
  <li>Slot hood</li>
  <li>Canopy hood and dedicated equipment exhaust</li>
  <li>Snorkels and spot exhausts</li>
  <li>Laminar flow clean air station</li>
  <li>Glove box</li>
  <li>Ventilated enclosure</li>
</ul>
