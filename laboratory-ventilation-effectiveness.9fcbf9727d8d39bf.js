CFD is based on laws of Physics such as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. CFD has been routinely employed in a wide of variety of industrial applications ranging from aerospace to automotive, and data centers to competitive sports. CFD simulations yield a wealth of information, including, but not limited to time-varying three dimensional (3D) distributions of air velocity, pressure, temperature, chemical concentrations, and plume dispersion, for example. This information can guide the HVAC design and help develop efficient and effective design of laboratory ventilation systems. CFD simulations help in visualization of airflow patterns and flow path of contaminants in a 3D space. Such analyses if performed at the early stages of the design can help in identifying potential pitfalls in the HVAC design and help to develop mitigation strategies.

This analysis showed occupants closer to the exhaust grille can be exposed to a higher level contaminant concentration than those closer to the source of contaminants. Furthermore, this study indicated that monitoring of the laboratory environment using concentration levels in the exhaust duct can compromise the safety of occupants. Due to highly non-uniform nature of the contaminant distribution, monitoring in the exhaust duct may underestimate the chemical exposure (dose) for some occupants. However, a simple modification such as an addition of an extra exhaust grille can significantly affect the contaminant distribution in the space resulting in reduced contaminant concentration levels and lower chemical exposure (dose) of occupants. Another CFD study emphasized that the design of HVAC system can more significantly influence the contaminant exposure levels than just air changes per hour (ACH).
