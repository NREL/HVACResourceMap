Commonly used filters include fiberglass; polyester; pleated, high efficiency particulate (HEPA) and washable air filters. Filter effectiveness is rated based on the minimum energy reporting value (MERV) ranging from 1 to 16. The higher the MERV rating, the more effective the filter, i.e., it can catch finer particles. Filters with higher MERV ratings have higher pressure drops compared to those with lower MERV ratings; however, not all high-MERV filters have high pressure drops. MERV ratings \u2265 are efficient for capturing airborne viruses.
